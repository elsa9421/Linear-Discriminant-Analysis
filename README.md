# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis
Linear Discriminant Analysis: The code creates a plot showing two Gaussian classes in 2d. They are parameterize the covariance matrix by parameters lambda_1 and theta, and has an interactive widget which shows the LDA hyperplane as the parameter varies. It also plots elliptical contours of the Gaussian densities and a small number of data points. The parameters should control the eccentricity of the ellipse associated to the covariance matrix.
